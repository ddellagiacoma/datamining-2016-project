Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed, fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits, so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of, I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things.
